\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we explore the application of digital twins in automated driving and propose Urban Vehicle Digital Twin(UVDT), which replicates the traffic flow by investigating four aspects: single-intersection multi-target tracking, multi-intersection multi-target tracking, trajectory inference and reduction, and twinning. 
The multi-target tracking performance is optimized by fusing radar detection and camera detection data to improve the accuracy and robustness of vehicle detection, which in turn solves the challenges posed by occlusion and view angle changes. 
Cross-scene vehicle re-recognition is improved by generating rich training data. 
The digital twin-based vehicle control method provides high-precision path planning and control for the autonomous driving system, ensuring accurate vehicle navigation in complex traffic scenarios. 
The experimental results show that UVDT can provide high-fidelity simulation scenarios for the testing and optimization of autonomous driving systems, which promotes the development of intelligent transportation systems and provides important support for the construction of future smart cities.
