This paper explores the application of digital twin technology in autonomous driving, introducing the concept of Urban Vehicle Digital Twin (UVDT). 
By studying vehicle detection, target tracking, re-identification, and trajectory reconstruction, the traffic flow is replicated. 
The use of digital twin technology combined with sensor data improves the accuracy and robustness of vehicle detection. 
The virtual environment optimizes multi-target tracking performance, addressing challenges such as occlusion and changes in viewpoint. 
In the area of re-identification, the generation of rich training data enhances cross-scene vehicle re-identification capabilities. 
The vehicle control method based on digital twin provides high-precision path planning and control for autonomous driving systems, ensuring accurate navigation in complex traffic scenarios. 
Experimental results show that UVDT effectively optimizes various modules of the autonomous driving system, advancing intelligent transportation systems and offering important support for the development of future smart cities.
