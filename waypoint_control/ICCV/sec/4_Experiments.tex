\section{Experiments}

We conducted the following experiments: 
(a) 3D object detection using PointPillars deep learning for LiDAR, 
(b) object-level fusion of LiDAR and camera data for object tracking, 
(c) vehicle re-identification between intersections using a ReID network, and 
(d) controlling the vehicle to achieve trajectory reproduction.
