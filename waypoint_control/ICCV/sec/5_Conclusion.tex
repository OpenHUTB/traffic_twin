\section{Conclusion}

Through a series of experiments, we have demonstrated the application value of digital twins in intelligent transportation. 
Digital twin technology can not only accurately replicate real-world traffic scenarios but also effectively predict future traffic conditions. 
Multi-target tracking and the inference of unknown trajectories serve as strong evidence of this capability. 
This holds significant value for the development of future cities.

We hope that new large-scale datasets will be introduced in the future to further enhance the effectiveness of digital twins.
